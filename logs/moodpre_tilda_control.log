Chain 1 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 1 Exception: skew_normal_lpdf: Scale parameter is 0, but must be positive! (in '/var/folders/hl/dt523djx7_q7xjrthzjpdvc40000gn/T/RtmpZ6sg0l/model-599e716763af.stan', line 100, column 4 to column 53)
Chain 1 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 1 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
